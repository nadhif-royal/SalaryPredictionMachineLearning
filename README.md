# Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict salaries based on years of experience. Developed during the **Data Series 16.0** course by **Dibimbing.id**, the project showcases the application of regression models and their performance evaluation.

## Features
- **Linear Regression**: Simple baseline model for linear relationships.
- **Decision Tree**: Non-linear model capable of capturing complex patterns.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble model providing robust and accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains:
- `experience_years`: Number of years of work experience.
- `salary`: Annual salary in USD.
